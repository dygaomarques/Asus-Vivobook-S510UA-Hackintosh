Please note that some SSD drives do not support TRIM. It is easy to find out if your SSD drive supports TRIM. Do the following:

- Launch "About This Mac" under the Apple menu
 -Click on "System Report"
- After it loads, Click on "SATA/SATA Express"
- Click on each of the drives till "Medium Type" in the list says "Solid State"
- The line right below this will say "Yes" or "No" to "TRIM SUPPORT". If it says "NO" TRIM will NOT work on your SSD!
