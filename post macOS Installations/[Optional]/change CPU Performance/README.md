# Modify macOS CPU Performance

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

## Instruction

I am really a newcomer for bash language, and welcome pros to help improve the script.

<b>The script is only for most 5th-8th generation CPU yet.</b> I will try to add support for more models if needed.

The script can modify low frequency mode and energy performance preference, and use [ResourceConverter.sh](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend/tree/master/ResourceConverter) to generate customized `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

By using this script, no file under the System folder will be edited. If you are not happy with the modification, just remove `CPUFriend*.kext` from `/CLOVER/kexts/Other/` and restart.


## Before install

- Read [CPUFriend WARNING](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend/blob/master/Instructions.md#warning)
- Good network
- If you have `FakeCPUID` argument in `config.plist`, this script may cause issue
- Make sure `IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext` untouched
- Make sure [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) is working
- Make sure you are using correct SMBIOS model
- `plugin-type=1`


## How to install

- Run this script in Terminal

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend/master/one-key-cpufriend.sh)"
```

- Copy `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` from desktop to `/CLOVER/kexts/Other/` and restart.


## Recovery

If you are not happy with the modification, just remove `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` from `/CLOVER/kexts/Other/` and restart.

If unfortunately, you can't boot into the system, and you are sure the issue is caused by `CPUFriend*.kext`,
 
 - Press `Space` when you are in Clover page
 - Use keyboard to choose `Block Injected kexts` - `Other`
 - Check `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`
 - Return to the main menu and boot into the system, then delete `CPUFriend*.kext` from your CLOVER folder
