Generate customized CPUFriendDataProvider.kext for dynamic macOS CPU power management

Modify macOS CPU Performance

Instruction

I am really a newcomer for bash language, and welcome pros to help improve the script.

The script is only for most 5th-8th generation CPU yet. I will try to add support for more models if needed.

The script can modify low frequency mode and energy performance preference, and use ResourceConverter.sh to generate customized CPUFriendDataProvider.kext.

By using this script, no file under the System folder will be edited. If you are not happy with the modification, just remove CPUFriend*.kext from /CLOVER/kexts/Other/ and restart.
Before install

    Read CPUFriend WARNING
    Good network
    If you have FakeCPUID argument in config.plist, this script may cause issue
    Make sure IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext untouched
    Make sure Lilu is working
    Make sure you are using correct SMBIOS model
    plugin-type=1

How to install

    Run this script in Terminal

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend/master/one-key-cpufriend.sh)"

    Copy CPUFriend.kext and CPUFriendDataProvider.kext from desktop to /CLOVER/kexts/Other/ and restart.

Recovery

If you are not happy with the modification, just remove CPUFriend.kext and CPUFriendDataProvider.kext from /CLOVER/kexts/Other/ and restart.

If unfortunately, you can't boot into the system, and you are sure the issue is caused by CPUFriend*.kext,

    Press Space when you are in Clover page
    Use keyboard to choose Block Injected kexts - Other
    Check CPUFriend.kext and CPUFriendDataProvider.kext
    Return to the main menu and boot into the system, then delete CPUFriend*.kext from your CLOVER folder
