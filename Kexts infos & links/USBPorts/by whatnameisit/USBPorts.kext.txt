Thanks to @whatnameisit for sharing his finding ¹: "For working BT after sleep, create codeless kext with BT USB port set as internal: I found the solution to this problem from experience as well as somewhere on github."

Procedure:
- remove SSDT-UIAC-ALL.aml from EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched
- remove USBInjectAll.kext from EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other and/or /L/E
- download attached USBPorts.kext ² (kindly supplied by whatnameisit) and apply it to EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other and/or /L/E

reboot

whatnameisit Jan. 6, 2020: "This USBPorts.kext correctly matches against Models MBP11,1 14,1 15,2 and 15,4" ³
