NoTouchID

Lilu plugin for disabling Touch ID support.

BiometricKit.framework in 10.13.4+ assumes a Touch ID sensor is present when a compatible board ID is used, which causes lag in authentication dialogs (as well as a delayed login screen). Patching this out resolves such hangs.

Configuration:

    Add -nobiooff to disable NoTouchID
    Add -nobiobeta to enable NoTouchID on unsupported OS versions (10.13/10.14 are supported by default)
