WhateverGreen.kext by lvs1974 is a plugin for Lilu

Various patches necessary for certain ATI/ AMD/ Intel/ Nvidia GPUs on various systems.

Must be installed with Lilu.kext (requires Lilu 1.2.5 or newer)

Install in /Library/Extensions.

Features

    Fixes boot to black screen on AMD and NVIDIA
    Fixes sleep wake to black screen on AMD
    Fixes boot screen distortion in certain cases
    Fixes transmitter/encoder in autodetected connectors for multimonitor support (-raddvi)
    Fixes HD 7730/7750/7770/R7 250/R7 250X initialisation (radpg=15)
    Allows tuning of aty_config, aty_properties, cail_properties via ACPI
    Allows enforcing 24-bit mode on unsupported displays (-rad24)
    Allows booting without video acceleration (-radvesa)
    Allows automatically setting GPU model name or providing it manually for RadeonFramebuffer
    Allows specifying custom connectors via device properties for RadeonFramebuffer
    Allows tuning autodetected connector priority via device properties (HD 7xxx or newer)
    Fixes an issue in AppleGraphicsDevicePolicy.kext so that we could use a MacPro6,1 board-id/model combination, without the usual hang with a black screen. Patching AppleGraphicsDevicePolicy.kext
    Modifies macOS to recognize NVIDIA's web drivers as platform binaries. This resolves the issue with transparent windows without content, which appear for applications that use Metal and have Library Validation enabled. Common affected applications are iBooks and Little Snitch Network Monitor, though this patch is universal and fixes them all. NVWebDriverLibValFix
    Injects IOVARendererID into GPU properties (required for Shiki-based solution for non-freezing Intel and/or any discrete GPU)
    Allows to use ports HDMI, DP, Digital DVI with audio (Injects @0connector-type - @5connector-type properties into GPU)
    Fixes NVIDIA GPU interface stuttering on 10.13 (official and web drivers)

    ngfxgl=1 boot argument (and disable-metal property) to disable Metal support on NVIDIA
    ngfxcompat=1 boot argument (and force-compat property) to ignore compatibility check in NVDAStartupWeb
    ngfxsubmit=0 boot argument to disable interface stuttering fix on 10.13
    igfxrst=1 to prefer drawing Apple logo at 2nd boot stage instead of framebuffer copying.
    igfxframe=frame to inject a dedicated framebuffer identifier into IGPU (only for TESTING purposes).
    igfxsnb=0 to disable IntelAccelerator name fix for Sandy Bridge CPUs.
    igfxgl=0 to disable Metal support on Intel.
